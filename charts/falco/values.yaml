  # and can be uniformly converted to megabytes (MB) using the
  # `convert_memory_to_mb` functionality. In environments such as Kubernetes when
  # deployed as daemonset, it is crucial to track Falco's container memory usage.

  # variable named `FALCO_CGROUP_MEM_PATH` and set it to the desired file path. By
  # default, Falco uses the file `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes` to
  # monitor container memory usage, which aligns with Kubernetes'
  # `container_memory_working_set_bytes` metric. Finally, we emit the overall host
  # CPU and memory usages, along with the total number of processes and open file

  # Falco rules files #
  #####################

  # [Stable] `rules_file`
  #
  # Falco rules can be specified using files or directories, which are loaded at
  # startup. The name "rules_file" is maintained for backwards compatibility. If
  # the entry is a file, it will be read directly. If the entry is a directory,
  # all files within that directory will be read in alphabetical order.
  #
  # The falco_rules.yaml file ships with the Falco package and is overridden with
  # every new software version. falco_rules.local.yaml is only created if it
  # doesn't already exist.
  #
  # To customize the set of rules, you can add your modifications to any file.
  # It's important to note that the files or directories are read in the order
  # specified here. In addition, rules are loaded by Falco in the order they
  # appear within each rule file.
  #
  # If you have any customizations intended to override a previous configuration,
  # make sure they appear in later files to take precedence. On the other hand, if
  # the conditions of rules with the same event type(s) have the potential to
  # overshadow each other, ensure that the more important rule appears first. This
  # is because rules are evaluated on a "first match wins" basis, where the first
  # rule that matches the conditions will be applied, and subsequent rules will
  # not be evaluated for the same event type.
  #
  # By arranging the order of files and rules thoughtfully, you can ensure that
  # desired customizations and rule behaviors are prioritized and applied as
  # intended.
  # -- The location of the rules files that will be consumed by Falco.
  rules_files:
    - /etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml
    - /etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml
    - /etc/falco/rules.d

  # [Incubating] `rules`
  #
  # --- [Description]
  #
  # Falco rules can be enabled or disabled by name (with wildcards *) and/or by tag.
  #
  # This configuration is applied after all rules files have been loaded, including
  # their overrides, and will take precedence over the enabled/disabled configuration
  # specified or overridden in the rules files.
  #
  # The ordering matters and selections are evaluated in order. For instance, if you
  # need to only enable a rule you would first disable all of them and then only
  # enable what you need, regardless of the enabled status in the files.
  #
  # --- [Examples]
  #
  # Only enable two rules:
  #
  # rules:
  #   - disable:
  #       rule: "*"
  #   - enable:
  #       rule: Netcat Remote Code Execution in Container
  #   - enable:
  #       rule: Delete or rename shell history
  #
  # Disable all rules with a specific tag:
  #
  # rules:
  #   - disable:
  #       tag: network
  #

  # [Incubating] `rule_matching`
  #
  # - Falco has to be performant when evaluating rules against events. To quickly
  # understand which rules could trigger on a specific event, Falco maintains
  # buckets of rules sharing the same event type in a map. Then, the lookup
  # in each bucket is performed through linear search. The `rule_matching`
  # configuration key's values are:
  #  - "first": when evaluating conditions of rules in a bucket, Falco will stop
  #    to evaluate rules if it finds a matching rules. Since rules are stored
  #    in buckets in the order they are defined in the rules files, this option
  #    could prevent other rules to trigger even if their condition is met, causing
  #    a shadowing problem.
  #  - "all": with this value Falco will continue evaluating all the rules
  #    stored in the bucket, so that multiple rules could be triggered upon one
  #    event.

  rule_matching: first

  # [Incubating] `outputs_queue`
  #
  # -- Falco utilizes tbb::concurrent_bounded_queue for handling outputs, and this parameter
  # allows you to customize the queue capacity. Please refer to the official documentation:
  # https://uxlfoundation.github.io/oneTBB/main/tbb_userguide/Concurrent_Queue_Classes.html.
  # On a healthy system with optimized Falco rules, the queue should not fill up.
  # If it does, it is most likely happening due to the entire event flow being too slow,
  # indicating that the server is under heavy load.
  #
  # `capacity`: the maximum number of items allowed in the queue is determined by this value.
  # Setting the value to 0 (which is the default) is equivalent to keeping the queue unbounded.
  # In other words, when this configuration is set to 0, the number of allowed items is
  # effectively set to the largest possible long value, disabling this setting.
  #
  # In the case of an unbounded queue, if the available memory on the system is consumed,
  # the Falco process would be OOM killed. When using this option and setting the capacity,
  # the current event would be dropped, and the event loop would continue. This behavior mirrors
  # kernel-side event drops when the buffer between kernel space and user space is full.

  # Falco plugins #
  #################

  # [Stable] `load_plugins` and `plugins`
  #
  # --- [Description]
  #
  # Falco plugins enable integration with other services in the your ecosystem.
  # They allow Falco to extend its functionality and leverage data sources such as
  # Kubernetes audit logs or AWS CloudTrail logs. This enables Falco to perform
  # fast on-host detections beyond syscalls and container events. The plugin
  # system will continue to evolve with more specialized functionality in future
  # releases.
  #
  # Please refer to the plugins repo at
  # https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/blob/master/plugins/ for detailed
  # documentation on the available plugins. This repository provides comprehensive
  # information about each plugin and how to utilize them with Falco.
  #
  # Please note that if your intention is to enrich Falco syscall logs with fields
  # such as `k8s.ns.name`, `k8s.pod.name`, and `k8s.pod.*`, you do not need to use
  # the `k8saudit` plugin. This information is automatically extracted from the
  # container runtime socket. The `k8saudit` plugin is specifically designed to
  # integrate with Kubernetes audit logs and is not required for basic enrichment
  # of syscall logs with Kubernetes-related fields.
  #
  # --- [Usage]
  #
  # Disabled by default, indicated by an empty `load_plugins` list. Each plugin meant
  # to be enabled needs to be listed as explicit list item.

  # For example, if you want to use the `k8saudit` plugin,
  # ensure it is configured appropriately and then change this to:
  # load_plugins: [k8saudit, json]
  # -- Add here all plugins and their configuration. Please
  # consult the plugins documentation for more info. Remember to add the plugins name in
  # "load_plugins: []" in order to load them in Falco.

  # Falco config files #
  ######################

  # [Stable] `config_files`
  #
  # Falco will load additional configs files specified here.
  # Their loading is assumed to be made *after* main config file has been processed,
  # exactly in the order they are specified.
  # Therefore, loaded config files *can* override values from main config file.
  # Also, nested include is not allowed, ie: included config files won't be able to include other config files.
  #
  # Like for 'rules_files', specifying a folder will load all the configs files present in it in a lexicographical order.
  #
  # 3 merge-strategies are available:
  # `append` (default):
  #   * existing sequence keys will be appended
  #   * existing scalar keys will be overridden
  #   * non-existing keys will be added
  # `override`:
  #   * existing keys will be overridden
  #   * non-existing keys will be added
  # `add-only`:
  #   * existing keys will be ignored
  #   * non-existing keys will be added
  #
  # Each item on the list can be either a yaml map or a simple string.
  # The simple string will be interpreted as the config file path, and the `append` merge-strategy will be enforced.
  # When the item is a yaml map instead, it will be of the form: `   path: foo\n   strategy: X`.
  # When `strategy` is omitted, once again `append` is used.
  #
  # When a merge-strategy is enabled for a folder entry, all the included config files will use that merge-strategy.

  # [Stable] `buffered_outputs`
  #
  # -- Enabling buffering for the output queue can offer performance optimization,

  # output mechanism. By default, buffering is disabled (false).
  buffered_outputs: false

  # [Sandbox] `append_output`
  #
  # Add information to the Falco output.
  # With this setting you can add more information to the Falco output message, customizable by
  # rule, tag or source.
  # You can also add additional data that will appear in the output_fields property
  # of JSON formatted messages or gRPC output but will not be part of the regular output message.
  # This allows you to add custom fields that can help you filter your Falco events without
  # polluting the message text.
  #
  # Each append_output entry has an optional `match` map which specifies which rules will be
  # affected.
  # `match`:
  #   `rule`: append output only to a specific rule
  #   `source`: append output only to a specific source
  #   `tags`: append output only to rules that have all of the specified tags
  # If none of the above are specified (or `match` is omitted)
  # output is appended to all events.
  # If more than one match condition is specified output will be appended to events
  # that match all conditions.
  # And several options to add output:
  #   `extra_output`: add output to the Falco message
  #   `extra_fields`: add new fields to the JSON output and structured output, which will not
  #             affect the regular Falco message in any way. These can be specified as a
  #             custom name with a custom format or as any supported field
  #             (see: https://falco.org/docs/reference/rules/supported-fields/)
  #   `suggested_output`: enable the use of extractor plugins suggested fields for the matching source output.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # append_output:
  #   - match:
  #       source: syscall
  #     extra_output: "on CPU %evt.cpu"
  #     extra_fields:
  #       - home_directory: "${HOME}"
  #       - evt.hostname
  #
  # In the example above every event coming from the syscall source will get an extra message
  # at the end telling the CPU number. In addition, if `json_output` is true, in the "output_fields"
  # property you will find three new ones: "evt.cpu", "home_directory" which will contain the value of the
  # environment variable $HOME, and "evt.hostname" which will contain the hostname.

  # By default, we enable suggested_output for any source.
  # This means that any extractor plugin that indicates some of its fields
  # as suggested output formats, will see these fields in the output
  # in the form "foo_bar=$foo.bar"

  # [Stable] `output_timeout`
  #
  # Generates Falco operational logs when `log_level=notice` at minimum
  #
  # A timeout error occurs when a process or operation takes longer to complete
  # than the allowed or expected time limit. In the context of Falco, an output
  # timeout error refers to the situation where an output channel fails to deliver
  # an alert within a specified deadline. Various reasons, such as network issues,
  # resource constraints, or performance bottlenecks can cause timeouts.
  #
  # -- The `output_timeout` parameter specifies the duration, in milliseconds, to
  # wait before considering the deadline exceeded. By default, the timeout is set
  # to 2000ms (2 seconds), meaning that the consumer of Falco outputs can block
  # the Falco output channel for up to 2 seconds without triggering a timeout
  # error.
  #
  # Falco actively monitors the performance of output channels. With this setting
  # the timeout error can be logged, but please note that this requires setting
  # Falco's operational logs `log_level` to a minimum of `notice`.
  #
  # It's important to note that Falco outputs will not be discarded from the
  # output queue. This means that if an output channel becomes blocked
  # indefinitely, it indicates a potential issue that needs to be addressed by the
  # user.
  output_timeout: 2000

  # [Stable] `syscall_event_timeouts`
  #
  # -- Generates Falco operational logs when `log_level=notice` at minimum
  #
  # Falco utilizes a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to receive
  # events, such as system call information, in userspace. However, there may be
  # cases where timeouts occur in the underlying libraries due to issues in
  # reading events or the need to skip a particular event. While it is uncommon
  # for Falco to experience consecutive event timeouts, it has the capability to
  # detect such situations. You can configure the maximum number of consecutive
  # timeouts without an event after which Falco will generate an alert, but please
  # note that this requires setting Falco's operational logs `log_level` to a
  # minimum of `notice`. The default value is set to 1000 consecutive timeouts
  # without receiving any events. The mapping of this value to a time interval
  # depends on the CPU frequency.

    max_consecutives: 1000

  # [Stable] `syscall_event_drops`
  #
  # Generates "Falco internal: syscall event drop" rule output when `priority=debug` at minimum
  #
  # --- [Description]
  #
  # Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to pass system
  # call information. When Falco detects that this buffer is full and system calls
  # have been dropped, it can take one or more of the following actions:
  #   - ignore: do nothing (default when list of actions is empty)
  #   - log: log a DEBUG message noting that the buffer was full
  #   - alert: emit a Falco alert noting that the buffer was full
  #   - exit: exit Falco with a non-zero rc
  #
  # Notice it is not possible to ignore and log/alert messages at the same time.
  #
  # The rate at which log/alert messages are emitted is governed by a token
  # bucket. The rate corresponds to one message every 30 seconds with a burst of
  # one message (by default).
  #
  # The messages are emitted when the percentage of dropped system calls with
  # respect the number of events in the last second is greater than the given
  # threshold (a double in the range [0, 1]). If you want to be alerted on any
  # drops, set the threshold to 0.
  #
  # For debugging/testing it is possible to simulate the drops using the
  # `simulate_drops: true`. In this case the threshold does not apply.
  #
  # --- [Usage]
  #
  # Enabled by default, but requires Falco rules config `priority` set to `debug`.
  # Emits a Falco rule named "Falco internal: syscall event drop" as many times in
  # a given time period as dictated by the settings. Statistics here reflect the
  # delta in a 1s time period.
  #
  # If instead you prefer periodic metrics of monotonic counters at a regular
  # interval, which include syscall drop statistics and additional metrics,
  # explore the `metrics` configuration option.
  # -- For debugging/testing it is possible to simulate the drops using
  # the `simulate_drops: true`. In this case the threshold does not apply.

  # [Experimental] `metrics`
  #
  # -- Generates "Falco internal: metrics snapshot" rule output when `priority=info` at minimum
  #
  # periodic metric snapshots (including stats and resource utilization) captured
  # at regular intervals
  #
  # --- [Description]
  #
  # Consider these key points about the `metrics` feature in Falco:
  #
  # - It introduces a redesigned stats/metrics system.
  # - Native support for resource utilization metrics and specialized performance
  #   metrics.
  # - Metrics are emitted as monotonic counters at predefined intervals
  #   (snapshots).
  # - All metrics are consolidated into a single log message, adhering to the
  #   established rules schema and naming conventions.
  # - Additional info fields complement the metrics and facilitate customized
  #   statistical analyses and correlations.
  # - The metrics framework is designed for easy future extension.
  #
  # The `metrics` feature follows a specific schema and field naming convention.
  # All metrics are collected as subfields under the `output_fields` key, similar
  # to regular Falco rules. Each metric field name adheres to the grammar used in
  # Falco rules. There are two new field classes introduced: `falco.` and `scap.`.
  # The `falco.` class represents userspace counters, statistics, resource
  # utilization, or useful information fields. The `scap.` class represents
  # counters and statistics mostly obtained from Falco's kernel instrumentation
  # before events are sent to userspace, but can include scap userspace stats as
  # well.
  #
  # It's important to note that the output fields and their names can be subject
  # to change until the metrics feature reaches a stable release.
  #
  # To customize the hostname in Falco, you can set the environment variable
  # `FALCO_HOSTNAME` to your desired hostname. This is particularly useful in
  # Kubernetes deployments where the hostname can be set to the pod name.
  #
  # --- [Usage]
  #
  # `enabled`: Disabled by default.
  #
  # `interval`: The stats interval in Falco follows the time duration definitions
  # used by Prometheus.
  # https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-durations
  #
  # Time durations are specified as a number, followed immediately by one of the
  # following units:
  #
  # ms - millisecond
  # s - second
  # m - minute
  # h - hour
  # d - day - assuming a day has always 24h
  # w - week - assuming a week has always 7d
  # y - year - assuming a year has always 365d
  #
  # Example of a valid time duration: 1h30m20s10ms
  #
  # A minimum interval of 100ms is enforced for metric collection. However, for
  # production environments, we recommend selecting one of the following intervals
  # for optimal monitoring:
  #
  # 15m
  # 30m
  # 1h
  # 4h
  # 6h
  #
  # `output_rule`: To enable seamless metrics and performance monitoring, we
  # recommend emitting metrics as the rule "Falco internal: metrics snapshot".
  # This option is particularly useful when Falco logs are preserved in a data
  # lake. Please note that to use this option, the Falco rules config `priority`
  # must be set to `info` at a minimum.
  #
  # `output_file`: Append stats to a `jsonl` file. Use with caution in production
  # as Falco does not automatically rotate the file.
  #
  # `resource_utilization_enabled`: Emit CPU and memory usage metrics. CPU usage
  # is reported as a percentage of one CPU and can be normalized to the total
  # number of CPUs to determine overall usage. Memory metrics are provided in raw
  # units (`kb` for `RSS`, `PSS` and `VSZ` or `bytes` for `container_memory_used`)
  # and can be uniformly converted to megabytes (MB) using the
  # `convert_memory_to_mb` functionality. In environments such as Kubernetes when
  # deployed as daemonset, it is crucial to track Falco's container memory usage.
  # To customize the path of the memory metric file, you can create an environment
  # variable named `FALCO_CGROUP_MEM_PATH` and set it to the desired file path. By
  # default, Falco uses the file `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes` to
  # monitor container memory usage, which aligns with Kubernetes'
  # `container_memory_working_set_bytes` metric. Finally, we emit the overall host
  # CPU and memory usages, along with the total number of processes and open file
  # descriptors (fds) on the host, obtained from the proc file system unrelated to
  # Falco's monitoring. These metrics help assess Falco's usage in relation to the
  # server's workload intensity.
  #
  # `rules_counters_enabled`: Emit counts for each rule.
  #
  # `resource_utilization_enabled`: Emit CPU and memory usage metrics. CPU usage
  # is reported as a percentage of one CPU and can be normalized to the total
  # number of CPUs to determine overall usage. Memory metrics are provided in raw
  # units (`kb` for `RSS`, `PSS` and `VSZ` or `bytes` for `container_memory_used`)
  # and can be uniformly converted to megabytes (MB) using the
  # `convert_memory_to_mb` functionality. In environments such as Kubernetes when
  # deployed as daemonset, it is crucial to track Falco's container memory usage.
  # To customize the path of the memory metric file, you can create an environment
  # variable named `FALCO_CGROUP_MEM_PATH` and set it to the desired file path. By
  # default, Falco uses the file `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes` to
  # monitor container memory usage, which aligns with Kubernetes'
  # `container_memory_working_set_bytes` metric. Finally, we emit the overall host
  # CPU and memory usages, along with the total number of processes and open file
  # descriptors (fds) on the host, obtained from the proc file system unrelated to
  # Falco's monitoring. These metrics help assess Falco's usage in relation to the
  # server's workload intensity.
  #
  # `state_counters_enabled`: Emit counters related to Falco's state engine, including
  # added, removed threads or file descriptors (fds), and failed lookup, store, or
  # retrieve actions in relation to Falco's underlying process cache table (threadtable).
  # We also log the number of currently cached containers if applicable.
  #
  # `kernel_event_counters_enabled`: Emit kernel side event and drop counters, as
  # an alternative to `syscall_event_drops`, but with some differences. These
  # counters reflect monotonic values since Falco's start and are exported at a
  # constant stats interval.
  #
  # `kernel_event_counters_per_cpu_enabled`: Detailed kernel event and drop counters
  # per CPU. Typically used when debugging and not in production.
  #
  # `libbpf_stats_enabled`: Exposes statistics similar to `bpftool prog show`,
  # providing information such as the number of invocations of each BPF program
  # attached by Falco and the time spent in each program measured in nanoseconds.
  # To enable this feature, the kernel must be >= 5.1, and the kernel
  # configuration `/proc/sys/kernel/bpf_stats_enabled` must be set. This option,
  # or an equivalent statistics feature, is not available for non `*bpf*` drivers.
  # Additionally, please be aware that the current implementation of `libbpf` does
  # not support granularity of statistics at the bpf tail call level.
  #
  # `include_empty_values`: When the option is set to true, fields with an empty
  # numeric value will be included in the output. However, this rule does not
  # apply to high-level fields such as `n_evts` or `n_drops`; they will always be
  # included in the output even if their value is empty. This option can be
  # beneficial for exploring the data schema and ensuring that fields with empty
  # values are included in the output.

  #######################################

  # [Experimental] `base_syscalls`, use with caution, read carefully
  #
  # --- [Description]
  #
  # -- This option configures the set of syscalls that Falco traces.
  #
  # --- [Falco's State Engine]
  #
  # Falco requires a set of syscalls to build up state in userspace. For example,
  # when spawning a new process or network connection, multiple syscalls are
  # involved. Furthermore, properties of a process during its lifetime can be
  # modified by syscalls. Falco accounts for this by enabling the collection of
  # additional syscalls than the ones defined in the rules and by managing a smart
  # process cache table in userspace. Processes are purged from this table when a
  # process exits.
  #
  # By default, with
  #   ```
  #   base_syscalls.custom_set = []
  #   base_syscalls.repair = false
  #   ```
  # Falco enables tracing for a syscall set gathered: (1) from (enabled) Falco
  #   rules (2) from a static, more verbose set defined in
  #   `libsinsp::events::sinsp_state_sc_set` in
  #   libs/userspace/libsinsp/events/sinsp_events_ppm_sc.cpp This allows Falco to
  #   successfully build up it's state engine and life-cycle management.
  #
  # If the default behavior described above does not fit the user's use case for
  # Falco, the `base_syscalls` option allows for finer end-user control of
  # syscalls traced by Falco.
  #
  # --- [base_syscalls.custom_set]
  #
  # CAUTION: Misconfiguration of this setting may result in incomplete Falco event
  # logs or Falco being unable to trace events entirely.
  #
  # `base_syscalls.custom_set` allows the user to explicitly define an additional
  # set of syscalls to be traced in addition to the syscalls from each enabled
  # Falco rule.
  #
  # This is useful in lowering CPU utilization and further tailoring Falco to
  # specific environments according to your threat model and budget constraints.
  #
  # --- [base_syscalls.repair]
  #
  # `base_syscalls.repair` is an alternative to Falco's default state engine
  # enforcement. When enabled, this option is designed to (1) ensure that Falco's
  # state engine is correctly and successfully built-up (2) be the most system
  # resource-friendly by activating the least number of additional syscalls
  # (outside of those enabled for enabled rules)
  #
  # Setting `base_syscalls.repair` to `true` allows Falco to automatically
  # configure what is described in the [Suggestions] section below.
  #
  # `base_syscalls.repair` can be enabled with an empty custom set, meaning with
  # the following,
  #   ```
  #   base_syscalls.custom_set = []
  #   base_syscalls.repair = true
  #   ```
  # Falco enables tracing for a syscall set gathered: (1) from (enabled) Falco
  #   rules (2) from minimal set of additional syscalls needed to "repair" the
  #   state engine and properly log event conditions specified in enabled Falco
  #   rules
  #
  # --- [Usage]
  #
  # List of system calls names (<syscall-name>), negative ("!<syscall-name>")
  # notation supported.
  #
  # Example: base_syscalls.custom_set: [<syscall-name>, <syscall-name>,
  # "!<syscall-name>"] base_syscalls.repair: <bool>
  #
  # We recommend to only exclude syscalls, e.g. "!mprotect" if you need a fast
  # deployment update (overriding rules), else remove unwanted syscalls from the
  # Falco rules.
  #
  # Passing `-o "log_level=debug" -o "log_stderr=true" --dry-run` to Falco's cmd
  # args will print the final set of syscalls to STDOUT.
  #
  # --- [Suggestions]
  #
  # NOTE: setting `base_syscalls.repair: true` automates the following suggestions
  # for you.
  #
  # These suggestions are subject to change as Falco and its state engine evolve.
  #
  # For execve* events: Some Falco fields for an execve* syscall are retrieved
  # from the associated `clone`, `clone3`, `fork`, `vfork` syscalls when spawning
  # a new process. The `close` syscall is used to purge file descriptors from
  # Falco's internal thread / process cache table and is necessary for rules
  # relating to file descriptors (e.g. open, openat, openat2, socket, connect,
  # accept, accept4 ... and many more)
  #
  # Consider enabling the following syscalls in `base_syscalls.custom_set` for
  # process rules: [clone, clone3, fork, vfork, execve, execveat, close]
  #
  # For networking related events: While you can log `connect` or `accept*`
  # syscalls without the socket syscall, the log will not contain the ip tuples.
  # Additionally, for `listen` and `accept*` syscalls, the `bind` syscall is also
  # necessary.
  #
  # We recommend the following as the minimum set for networking-related rules:
  # [clone, clone3, fork, vfork, execve, execveat, close, socket, bind,
  # getsockopt]
  #
  # Lastly, for tracking the correct `uid`, `gid` or `sid`, `pgid` of a process
  # when the running process opens a file or makes a network connection, consider
  # adding the following to the above recommended syscall sets: ... setresuid,
  # setsid, setuid, setgid, setpgid, setresgid, setsid, capset, chdir, chroot,
  # fchdir ...

  # [Incubating] `container_engines`
  #
  # This option allows you to explicitly enable or disable API lookups against container

  # Refer to the fields docs:
  #
  # - [Kubernetes fields](https://falco.org/docs/reference/rules/supported-fields/#field-class-k8s)
  # - [Container fields](https://falco.org/docs/reference/rules/supported-fields/#container)
  #
  # Additionally, Falco can use container events as a data source for alerting (evt.type = container).
  #
  # For most container engines, you can solely enable or disable them, and Falco will search the
  # default (hard-coded) container runtime socket paths, such as `/var/run/docker.sock` for Docker.
  #
  # However, for Kubernetes settings, you can customize the CRI socket paths:
  #
  # - `container_engines.cri.sockets`: Pass a list of container runtime sockets.
  # - `container_engines.cri.disable_async`: Since API lookups may not always be quick or
